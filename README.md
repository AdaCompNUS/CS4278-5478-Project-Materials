# CS4278-5478-Project-Materials


## Evaluation  
We will evaluate your system on 5 [maps](./maps/) to compute the average accumulated reward. A primary component of your grade is the  reward achieved.

Make sure to pull the latest maps into the map folder of your gym-duckietown environment:
```
cp maps/* /path/to/your-gym-duckietown-repo/gym-duckietown/maps/
```
Each map is associated with several [random seeds](./seeds.json).  To initialize the gym-duckietown environment, there are three  arguments:
- `--map-name`: the name of the map
- `--seed`: random seed of the environment 
- `--max-steps`: the maximum run step. The default value is 1500.  Do not change this default value when you generate the control files for submission.

Similar to Assignment 3,  generate the control files for submission. 

A sample file for the python environment is available [here](./example.py). We also include a [sample control file](./map5_seed11.txt). It illustrates how to add arguments and output your controls to a file. To try our simple policy, 
```
python example.py --map-name map5 --seed 11
```

1. The Duckiebot must recognize the sign from camera images. It must slow down below 0.15m/s if it is within 0.3m of a stop sign. 
1. Oscillating in place may generate a high score in the simulator, but will be penalized in our evaluation. This is a flaw in the Duckietown simulator. See the Forum post under *High cumulative reward but "ridiculous" policy*. 




## Submission
The submission consists of two parts. 

- For each map and each random seed ([random seeds](./seeds.json)), save your controls to a file named  "map{map_number}_seed{seed_number}.txt". For example, 
  - map1_seed5.txt
  - map2_seed1.txt

  Check `example.py` for the format of the control file and make sure the submitted file is in correct format. 

- Provide a short report (up to 2 pages, Times Roman 10 point) to  describe your apporach. In particular, if you follow the classic modular system design approach, provide a system diagram and describe
  - how the system processes the visual input,
  - how it determines the position with respect to the lane,
  - how it controls the vehicle. 

  If you adopt a end-to-end neural network learning approach, provide the network architecture diagram. Explain your architecture choices, algorithms and modules, if any.

- Organize your submission folder **strictly** according to the following structure:
```
student_id.zip
|-- report.pdf
|-- code
|-- control_files
    |-- map*_seed*.txt
    |-- ...
```
